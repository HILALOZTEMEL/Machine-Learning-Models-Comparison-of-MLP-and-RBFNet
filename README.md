# Machine Learning Models: Comparison of MLP and RBFNet
This project focuses on learning models (such as MLP and RBFNet). It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis. The code and explanations are provided in Jupyter Notebook format.

# What are MLP and RBFNet?

**MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**

MLP is a fundamental type of artificial neural network with a feedforward structure. Each layer processes inputs from the previous layer and passes them to the next. The weights and biases are typically optimized using the backpropagation algorithm.

**Purpose:**

- Used in supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression.

- Provides an effective solution for high-dimensional and complex data.

**RBFNet (Radial Basis Function Network)**

RBFNet processes inputs using radial basis activation functions. These networks usually consist of a single hidden layer and transform input data based on distances to central points in the hidden layer.

**Purpose:**

- Used in classification and function approximation problems.

- Preferred for simple datasets due to its fast and effective solutions.

**Contents**

The notebook includes the following main sections:

**Data Transformation and Preparation:**

- Converting datasets to Tensor format using PyTorch and torchvision.

- Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

**Model Creation and Training:**

- Defining MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and RBFNet (Radial Basis Function Network) models.

- Training models with GPU support.

**Evaluation:**

- Calculating accuracy on test data.

- Generating classification reports and confusion matrices.

- Results and Visualization:

- Plotting training loss values.

- Comparing classification performance of the models.
